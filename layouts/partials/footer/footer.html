                Georama is an open-source web publishing platform for the QGIS
                ecosystem, designed to streamline the deployment and serving of
                geospatial data through modern, standards-based web services. It
                enables organisations to publish, manage, and scale geodata
                workflows while retaining full control over permissions,
                infrastructure, and data ownership.
